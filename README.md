JETMAN JR
-------------

Use your jetpack to explore caverns! Destroy your enemies with lasers and dynamites. Your mission: to find the
old git that got lost exploring the caverns looking for treasure. Find him, Jetman. Be the hero!

Also, this game is loosely about branching. After the inital tutorial level, you are presented
with a screen of branches. Some routes are easier than others. One fateful branch leads to your 
certain death.
